Remove files
Files can be removed from a storage bucket using the
remove
API. If a file is protected by an identity Id, only the user who owns the file will be able to remove it.
You can also perform a remove operation from a specific bucket by providing the target bucket's assigned name from Amplify Backend in
bucket
option.
Alternatively, you can also pass in an object by specifying the bucket name and region from the console.
