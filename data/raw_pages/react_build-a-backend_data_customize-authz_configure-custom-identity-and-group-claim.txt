Configure custom identity and group claims
Amplify Data supports using custom identity and group claims if you do not wish to use the default Amazon Cognito-provided
cognito:groups
or the double-colon-delimited claims,
sub::username
, from your JWT token. This can be helpful if you are using tokens from a 3rd party OIDC system or if you wish to populate a claim with a list of groups from an external system, such as when using a
Pre Token Generation Lambda Trigger
which reads from a database.
To use custom claims specify
identityClaim
or
groupClaim
as appropriate. In the example below, the
identityClaim
is specified and the record owner will check against this
user_id
claim. Similarly, if the
user_groups
claim contains a "Moderator" string then access will be granted.
In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using
client.models.<model-name>
with the
userPool
auth mode.
