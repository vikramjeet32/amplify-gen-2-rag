Manage WebAuthn credentials
Amplify Auth enables your users to associate, keep track of, and delete passkeys.
Note that users must be authenticated to register a passkey. That also means users cannot create a passkey during sign up; consequently, they must have at least one other first factor authentication mechanism associated with their account to use WebAuthn.
You can associate a passkey using the following API:
The user will be prompted to register a passkey using their local authenticator. Amplify will then associate that passkey with Cognito.
You can list registered passkeys using the following API:
You can delete a passkey with the following API:
Here is a code example that uses the list and delete APIs together. In this example, the user has 3 passkeys registered. They want to list all passkeys while using a
pageSize
of 2 as well as delete the first passkey in the list.
