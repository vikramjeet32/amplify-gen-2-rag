Switching authentication flows
For client side authentication there are four different flows:
USER_SRP_AUTH
: The
USER_SRP_AUTH
flow uses the
SRP protocol (Secure Remote Password)
where the password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server. This is the recommended flow and is used by default.
USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
: The
USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
flow will send user credentials to the backend without applying SRP encryption. If you want to migrate users to Cognito using the "Migration" trigger and avoid forcing users to reset their passwords, you will need to use this authentication type because the Lambda function invoked by the trigger needs to verify the supplied credentials.
CUSTOM_WITH_SRP
&
CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP
: Allows for a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements.
USER_AUTH
: The
USER_AUTH
flow is a choice-based authentication flow that allows the user to choose from the list of available authentication methods. This flow is useful when you want to provide the user with the option to choose the authentication method. The choices that may be available to the user are
EMAIL_OTP
,
SMS_OTP
,
WEB_AUTHN
,
PASSWORD
or
PASSWORD_SRP
.
The Auth flow can be customized when calling
signIn
, for example:
For more information about authentication flows, please visit
AWS Cognito developer documentation
The
USER_AUTH
sign in flow supports the following methods as first factors for authentication:
WEB_AUTHN
,
EMAIL_OTP
,
SMS_OTP
,
PASSWORD
, and
PASSWORD_SRP
.
If the desired first factor is known when authentication is initiated, it can be passed to the
signIn
API as the
preferredChallenge
to initiate the corresponding authentication flow.
If the desired first factor is not known or you would like to provide users with the available options,
preferredChallenge
can be omitted from the initial
signIn
API call.
This allows you to discover which authentication first factors are available for a user via the
CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_FIRST_FACTOR_SELECTION
step. You can then present the available options to the user and use the
confirmSignIn
API to respond with the user's selection.
Also, note that if the
preferredChallenge
passed to the initial
signIn
API call is unavailable for the user, Amplify will also respond with the
CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_FIRST_FACTOR_SELECTION
next step.
For more information about determining a first factor, and signing in with passwordless authentication factors, please visit the
Passwordless
concepts page.
A use case for the
USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
authentication flow is migrating users into Amazon Cognito
In order to use the authentication flow
USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
, your Cognito app client has to be configured to allow it. In the AWS Console, this is done by ticking the checkbox at General settings > App clients > Show Details (for the affected client) > Enable username-password (non-SRP) flow. If you're using the AWS CLI or CloudFormation, update your app client by adding
USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
to the list of "Explicit Auth Flows".
Amazon Cognito provides a trigger to migrate users from your existing user directory seamlessly into Cognito. You achieve this by configuring your User Pool's "Migration" trigger which invokes a Lambda function whenever a user that does not already exist in the user pool authenticates, or resets their password.
In short, the Lambda function will validate the user credentials against your existing user directory and return a response object containing the user attributes and status on success. An error message will be returned if an error occurs. Visit
Amazon Cognito user pools import guide
for migration flow and more detailed instruction, and
Amazon Cognito Lambda trigger guide
on how to set up lambda to handle request and response objects.
Amazon Cognito user pools supports customizing the authentication flow to enable custom challenge types,
in addition to a password in order to verify the identity of users. These challenge types may include CAPTCHAs
or dynamic challenge questions. The
CUSTOM_WITH_SRP
flow requires a password when calling
signIn
. Both of
these flows map to the
CUSTOM_AUTH
flow in Cognito.
To initiate a custom authentication flow in your app, call
signIn
without a password. A custom challenge needs to be answered using the
confirmSignIn
API:
