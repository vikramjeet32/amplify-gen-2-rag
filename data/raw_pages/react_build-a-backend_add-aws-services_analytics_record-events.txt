Record events
To record custom events call the
record
API:
Analytics events are buffered in memory and periodically sent to the service and not saved locally between application sessions. If the session is ended before a buffered event is sent, it will be lost. Use the
flushEvents
API to manually send buffered events to the service.
The
record
API lets you add additional attributes to an event. For example, to record
artist
information with an
albumVisit
event:
Recorded events will be buffered and periodically sent to Amazon Pinpoint.
Metrics can also be added to an event:
Metric values must be a
Number
type such as a float or integer.
The Amazon Pinpoint event count updates in minutes after recording your event.
However, it can take upwards of 30 minutes for the event to display in the Filter section, and for its custom attributes to appear in Amazon Pinpoint.
The recorded events are saved in a buffer and sent to the remote server periodically. If needed, you have the option to manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the 'flushEvents' API.
