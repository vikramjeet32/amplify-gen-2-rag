Define authorization rules
When determining the authorization mode for your REST endpoint, there are a few customizations you can do.
By default, the API will be using IAM authorization and the requests will be signed for you automatically. IAM authorization has two modes: one using an
unauthenticated
role, and one using an
authenticated
role. When the user has not signed in, the unauthenticated role is used by default. Once the user has signed in, the authenticate role is used, instead.
If you want to configure a public REST API, you can set an API key in Amazon API Gateway or create one using the
CDK construct
. Then, you can set the API key header in the API configuration which will be applied to all requests.
You can use the access token from configured Cognito User Pool to authenticate against REST endpoint. The JWT token can be retrieved from the
Auth
category.
Then you need to set the Authorization header in the API category configuration. The following example shows how to set the Authorization header for all requests.

The ID Token contains claims about the identity of the authenticated user such as name, email, and phone_number. On the Amplify Authentication category you can retrieve the Id Token using:
The Access Token contains scopes and groups and is used to grant access to authorized resources.
This is a tutorial for enabling custom scopes

If you want to use a custom authorization token, you can set the token in the API category configuration. The custom authorization token will be applied to all requests.
Alternatively, you can set the authorization headers per request. For example, if you want to use a custom header named
Authorization
for a specific REST request, you can set the following configuration:
