Manage passwords
Amplify Auth provides a secure way for your users to change their password or recover a forgotten password.
By default, your users can retrieve access to their accounts if they forgot their password by using either their phone or email. The following are the default account recovery methods used when either
phone
or
email
are used as login options.
To reset a user's password, use the
resetPassword
API which will send a reset code to the destination (e.g. email or SMS) based on the user's settings.
To complete the password reset process, invoke the
confirmResetPassword
API with the code your user received and the new password they want to set.
You can update a signed in user's password using the
updatePassword
API.
You can always change the channel used by your authentication resources by overriding the following setting.
By default your password policy is set to the following:
MinLength
: 8 characters
requireLowercase
: true
requireUppercase
: true
requireNumbers
: true
requireSymbols
: true
tempPasswordValidity
: 3 days
You can customize the password format acceptable by your auth resource by modifying the underlying
cfnUserPool
resource:
