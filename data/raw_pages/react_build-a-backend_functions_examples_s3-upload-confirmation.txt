S3 Upload confirmation
You can use
defineStorage
and
defineFunction
to create a function trigger to confirm uploading a file.
To get started, install the
@types/aws-lambda
package
, which contains types for different kinds of Lambda handlers, events, and responses.
Update your storage definition to define the onUpload trigger as below:
Next, create a file named
amplify/storage/on-upload-handler.ts
and use the following code to log the object keys whenever an object is uploaded to the bucket. You can add your custom logic to this function as needed.
Now, when you deploy your backend, this function will be invoked whenever an object is uploaded to the bucket.
