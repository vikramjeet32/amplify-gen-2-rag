With admin actions
Amplify Auth can be managed with the
AWS SDK's
@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider
package
. This package is intended to use server-side, and can be used within a Function. This example focuses on the
addUserToGroup
action and will be defined as a
custom mutation
.
To get started, create an "ADMINS" group that will be used to authorize the mutation:
Next, create the Function resource:
Then, in your auth resources, grant access for the function to perform the
addUserToGroup
action.

.
You're now ready to define the custom mutation. Here you will use the newly-created
addUserToGroup
function resource to handle the
addUserToGroup
mutation. This mutation can only be called by a user in the "ADMINS" group.
Lastly, create the function's handler using the exported client schema to type the handler function, and the generated
env
to specify the user pool ID you'd like to interact with:
In your frontend, use the generated client to call your mutation using the group name and the user's ID.
