Making a Contribution
How it works
The Amplify Contributor Program is open to everyone in the Amplify community! In the following steps, we describe what to expect when contributing:
The Amplify team labels issues using
good first issue
for contributors.
You open a pull request that contains commits you made yourself.
The Amplify team reviews your pull request.
If everything looks good, the Amplify team approves the pull request. (At this time, only accepted pull requests count toward earning badges.)
You collect an
Amplify badge
for your first contribution or make progress toward the Intermediate and Advanced badges!
The Amplify Badge Program
The Amplify Badge Program celebrates your contributions by offering you exclusive, eye-catching badges to display on your online profiles, such as LinkedIn, GitHub, or your own website.
