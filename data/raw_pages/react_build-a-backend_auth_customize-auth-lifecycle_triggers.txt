Triggers
Amplify Auth's behavior can be customized through the use of triggers. A trigger is defined as a Function, and is a mechanism to slot some logic to execute during the authentication flow. For example, you can use triggers to
validate whether emails include an allowlisted domain
,
add a user to a group upon confirmation
, or
create a "UserProfile" model upon account confirmation
.
Triggers translate to
Cognito user pool Lambda triggers
.
When you have a Lambda trigger assigned to your user pool, Amazon Cognito interrupts its default flow to request information from your function. Amazon Cognito generates a JSON event and passes it to your function. The event contains information about your user's request to create a user account, sign in, reset a password, or update an attribute. Your function then has an opportunity to take action, or to send the event back unmodified.
To get started, define a function and specify the
triggers
property on your auth resource:
