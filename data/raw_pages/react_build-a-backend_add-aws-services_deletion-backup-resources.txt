Deletion protection and Backup resources
Deleting a Amplify sandbox with a resource enabled with deletion protection, the deploy process will fail and the resource will need to be manually deleted on the AWS console.
Using the
AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
we can configure Amplify generated resource to enable deletion protection and backups on supported resources. For example, you can use AWS CDK to enable
Point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB tables
, or use
AWS Backup
as a advanced backup option.
Using underlying CDK construct properties you can modify resource configurations. This allows you to customize backend resources beyond what is offered via the
define*
functions.
For example, if you would like to enable deletion protection on a Cognito user pool resource created by Amplify Auth.
For example, if you would like to enable Deletion protection on all DynamoDB tables created by GraphQL API.
For example, enabling Point-in-time recovery for all the DynamoDB tables created by GraphQL API. By default Point-in-Time recovery retains backups for 35 days.
For example, if your DynamoDB tables requires backups that extend the default 35 days point-in-time recovery, AWS Backup service can be utilized to centralize and automate backups for DynamoDB tables.
The example below outlines a backup plan configured to run daily at midnight, for all DynamoDB tables.
For example, if you would like to retain a resource on stack deletion, you can use the
applyRemovalPolicy
property on the resource to add a retention policy.
ampx sandbox delete
ignores any resource removal policy and always deletes all resources.
