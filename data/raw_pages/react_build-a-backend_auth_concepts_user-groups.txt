User groups
Amplify Auth provides a mechanism that allows you to group users. Assigning users to groups enable you to customize access for a collection of users, or leverage for auditing purposes. For example, only "ADMINS" users are permitted to delete posts from a bulletin, or only "EDITORS" are permitted to modify posts in a "draft" state. To get started with groups, configure the
groups
property:
Amplify resources enable you to define access for groups using common language. For example, you can use
allow.groups
in data:
Or in storage:
By defining access with groups, Amplify configures authorization rules to read from the current user's groups. User pool groups are available as a claim in the user's ID token and access token as
cognito:groups
. Requests can be made to secure resources using the access token and validated against this claim to permit action on the resource.
Each Cognito user pool group is assigned an
IAM role
. IAM roles can be modified to extend access to other AWS resources. Roles can be accessed from your backend on the
role
property of your group:
