User group-based data access
You can use the
group
authorization strategy to restrict access based on user groups. The user group authorization strategy allows restricting data access to specific user groups or groups defined dynamically on each data record.
When you want to restrict access to a specific set of user groups, provide the group names in the
groups
parameter. In the example below, only users that are part of the "Admin" user group are granted access to the Salary model.
In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using
client.models.<model-name>
with the
userPool
auth mode.
import
{
generateClient
}
from
'aws-amplify/data'

This can then be updated to allow access to multiple defined groups; in this example below we added access for "Leadership".
With dynamic group authorization, each record contains an attribute specifying what Cognito groups should be able to access it. Use the first argument to specify which attribute in the underlying data store holds this group information. To specify that a single group should have access, use a field of type
a.string()
. To specify that multiple groups should have access, use a field of type
a.string().array()
.
By default,
group
authorization leverages Amazon Cognito user pool groups but you can also use OpenID Connect with
group
authorization. See
OpenID Connect as an authorization provider
.
Known limitations for real-time subscriptions when using dynamic group authorization:
If you authorize based on a single group per record, then subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 5 or fewer user groups
If you authorize via an array of groups (
groups: a.string().array()
used in the example above),
subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 20 or fewer groups
you can only authorize 20 or fewer user groups per record
You can access a user's groups from their session using the Auth category:
