Configure a geofence collection
A Geofence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area. A Geofence contains points or vertices that form a closed boundary, defining an area of interest. Geofence collections store one or multiple Geofences.
The pricing plan for the Geofence Collection will be set to
RequestBasedUsage
. We advice you to go through the
location service pricing
along with the
location service terms
(
82.5 section
) to learn more about the pricing plan.
Group access
To scope access permissions based on
Cognito User Groups
Create a Cognito User Pool Group
Add permissions to the Cognito User Pool Group role
Note: If you combine
Auth/Guest user access
and
Individual Group access
, users who are members of a group will only be granted the permissions of the group, and not the authenticated user permissions. The permissions apply to ALL Geofences in a collection. For example, If you add
Read
permission such as
ListGeofences
and
GetGeofence
to
User
Cognito group, ALL users added to that group will be able to read the properties of ALL Geofences in that Geofence collection.
Using the AWS SDK for Javascript
Alternatively, if you want to add users to an existing Cognito user pool group programmatically, you can use the AWS SDK for Javascript. Refer to the
API documentation
.
Note:
After you have provisioned the Geofence Collection, depending on your application's use-case, you can also add Geofences to the provisioned Geofence Collection programmatically. Refer this
API documentation
for more information.
