IAM policy
Branch deployments require the
AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess
managed policy to be able to deploy backend resources during a fullstack deployment. When connecting your project through the console, a role with this policy attached will be automatically created for you.
Sandbox deployments, by design, use local credentials to deploy resources. You need to ensure that the local profile has the
AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess
policy attached to it.
