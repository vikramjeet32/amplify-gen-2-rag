Enable logging
You can enable logging to debug your GraphQL API using Amazon CloudWatch logs. To learn more about logging and monitoring capabilities for your GraphQL API, visit the
AWS AppSync documentation for logging and monitoring
.
Default logging can be enabled by setting the
logging
property to
true
in the call to
defineData
. For example:

logging: true
applies the default configuration:
You can customize individual configuration values by providing a
DataLogConfig
object. For example:
WARNING
: Setting
excludeVerboseContent
to
false
logs full queries and user parameters, which can contain sensitive data. We recommend limiting CloudWatch log access to only those roles or users (e.g., DevOps or developers) who genuinely require it, by carefully scoping your IAM policies.
true
: Enables default logging.
DataLogConfig
object: Overrides one or more default fields.
