Manage user attributes
User attributes such as email address, phone number help you identify individual users. Defining the user attributes you include for your user profiles makes user data easy to manage at scale. This information will help you personalize user journeys, tailor content, provide intuitive account control, and more. You can capture information upfront during sign-up or enable customers to update their profile after sign-up. In this section we take a closer look at working with user attributes, how to set them up and manage them.
You can create user attributes during sign-up or when the user is authenticated. To do this as part of sign-up you can pass them in the
userAttributes
object of the
signUp
API:
Custom attributes can be passed in with the
userAttributes
option of the
signUp
API:
You can retrieve user attributes for your users to read in their profile using the
fetchUserAttributes
API. This helps you personalize their frontend experience as well as control what they will see.
You can use the
updateUserAttribute
API to create or update existing user attributes.
Note: If you change an attribute that requires confirmation (i.e. email or phone_number), the user will receive a confirmation code either to their email or cellphone. This code can be used with the confirmUserAttribute API to confirm the change.
You can use the
updateUserAttributes
API to create or update multiple existing user attributes.
Some attributes require confirmation for the attribute update to complete. If the attribute needs to be confirmed, part of the result of the
updateUserAttribute
or
updateUserAttributes
APIs will be
CONFIRM_ATTRIBUTE_WITH_CODE
. A confirmation code will be sent to the delivery medium mentioned in the delivery details. When the user gets the confirmation code, you can present a UI to the user to enter the code and invoke the
confirmUserAttribute
API with their input:
If an attribute needs to be verified while the user is authenticated, invoke the
sendUserAttributeVerificationCode
API as shown below:
The
deleteUserAttributes
API allows to delete one or more user attributes.
