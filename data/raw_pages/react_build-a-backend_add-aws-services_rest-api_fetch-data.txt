Fetch data
To invoke an endpoint, you need to set input object with required
apiName
option and optional
headers
,
queryParams
, and
body
options. API status code response > 299 are thrown as an
ApiError
instance. The error instance provides
name
and
message
properties parsed from the response.
The
retryStrategy
can be configured with:
no-retry
: Single attempt, fails immediately on error
jittered-exponential-backoff
: Default strategy that retries with increasing delays, maximum 3 attempts
You can consume the response payload by accessing the
body
property of the response object. Depending on the use case and the content type of the body, you can consume they payload in string, blob, or JSON.
You can not consume the response payload more than once.
The REST API handler may throw an
ApiError
error instance. If the error is caused by an HTTP response with a non-2xx status code, the error instance will provide a
response
property. The
response
property contains following
properties:
statusCode
: HTTP status code
headers
: HTTP response headers
body
: HTTP response body as a string
The following example shows how to access the HTTP response from an
ApiError
instance, so that you can handle the error response from your REST API endpoint:
