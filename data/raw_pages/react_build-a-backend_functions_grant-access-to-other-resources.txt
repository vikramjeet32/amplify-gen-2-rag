Grant access to other resources
In order for Amplify Functions to interact with other resources they must be given access. There are two ways to grant Amplify Functions access to other resources:
Using the
access
property
Using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
The
access
property is a property found in each of the
define*
functions for defining Amplify resources. It allows you specify the necessary actions using common language.
When you grant a function access to another resource in your Amplify backend (
such as granting access to storage
), it will configure environment variables for that function to make SDK calls to the AWS services it has access to. Those environment variables are typed and available as part of the
env
object.
Say you have a function that generates reports each month from your Data resource and needs to store the generated reports in Storage:
This access definition will add the environment variable
myReports_BUCKET_NAME
to the function. This environment variable can be accessed on the
env
object.
Here's an example of how it can be used to upload some content to S3.
When permissions are needed to access resources beyond the capabilities of the
access
property, you must use CDK.
Functions are created with an
execution role
, which is an IAM role that contains policies that dictate what resources your Function can interact with when it executes. This role can be extended using the
addToRolePolicy()
method:
However some constructs provide a
grant*
method to grant access to common policy actions. Revisiting the example above you can grant the same access with
grantPublish
