Copy files
Note:
You can only copy files up to 5GB in a single operation
You can copy an existing file to a different path within the storage bucket using the copy API.
The
copy
method duplicates an existing file to a designated path and returns an object
{path: 'destPath'}
upon successful completion.
The operation can fail if there's a special character in the
source
path. You should URI encode the source
path with special character. You
don't
need to encode the
destination
path.
Cross identity ID copying is only allowed if the destination path has the the right access rules to allow other authenticated users writing to it.
You can also perform an
copy
operation to a specific bucket by providing the
bucket
option. This option can either be a string representing the target bucket's assigned name in Amplify Backend or an object specifying the bucket name and region from the console.
In order to copy to or from a bucket other than your default, both source and destination must have
bucket
explicitly defined.
