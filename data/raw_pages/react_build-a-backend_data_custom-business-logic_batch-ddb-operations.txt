Batch DynamoDB Operations
Batch DynamoDB operations allow you to add multiple items in single mutation.
After your query or mutation is defined, you need to author your custom business logic using a
custom resolver powered by AppSync JavaScript resolver
.
Custom resolvers work on a "request/response" basis. You choose a data source, map your request to the data source's input parameters, and then map the data source's response back to the query/mutation's return type. Custom resolvers provide the benefit of no cold starts, less infrastructure to manage, and no additional charge for Lambda function invocations. Review
Choosing between custom resolver and function
.
In your
amplify/data/resource.ts
file, define a custom handler using
a.handler.custom
.
Amplify will store some values in the resolver context stash that can be accessed in the custom resolver.
The Amplify generated DynamoDB table names can be constructed from the variables in the context stash. The table name is in the format
<model-name>-<aws-appsync-api-id>-<amplify-api-environment-name>
. For example, the table name for the
Post
model would be
Post-123456-dev
where
123456
is the AppSync API ID and
dev
is the Amplify API environment name.
From your generated Data client, you can find all your custom queries and mutations under the
client.queries.
and
client.mutations.
APIs respectively.
