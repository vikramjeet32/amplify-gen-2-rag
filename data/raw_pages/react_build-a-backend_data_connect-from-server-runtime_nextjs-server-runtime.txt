Next.js server runtime
This guide walks through how you can connect to Amplify Data from Next.js Server-side Runtimes (SSR). For Next.js applications, Amplify provides first-class support for the
App Router (React Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions)
, the
Pages Router (Components, API Routes)
, and
Middleware
.
Before you begin, you will need:
Connecting to Amplify Data will include choosing the correct data client for Next.js server runtimes, generating the data client, and then calling the API.
Amplify offers two specialized data clients for Next.js server runtimes (from
@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs/data
) that you should use depending whether you retrieve the user tokens using
cookies
or
NextRequest
and
NextResponse
:
generateServerClientUsingCookies()
ðª generates a data client with the Next.js
cookies
function from
next/headers
. Each API request dynamically refetches the cookies at runtime.
generateServerClientUsingReqRes()
ð generates a data client requiring
NextRequest
and
NextResponse
provided to an
runWithAmplifyServerContext
function to prevent token contamination.
Choose the correct data client based on your Next.js Router (App or Pages) and then the use case:
generateServerClientUsingCookies() ðª
generateServerClientUsingReqRes() ð
To generate a Data client for the Next.js server runtime using cookies, you need to provide both your Amplify configuration and the cookies function from Next.js.
We recommend you generate Amplify Data's server client in a utility file. Then, import the generated client in your Next.js React Server Components, Server Actions, or Route Handlers.
To generate a data client for the Next.js server runtime using
NextRequest
and
NextResponse
, you only need to provide your Amplify configuration. When making the individual API requests, you will need to pass the config to the
runWithAmplifyServerContext
function to pass in the cookies from request and response variables.
We recommend you generate the server Data client in a utility file. Then, import the generated client in your Next.js Middleware, component's server runtime code, and API Routes.
You can make any available query or mutation request with the generated server data clients; however, note that subscriptions are not available within server runtimes.
generateServerClientUsingCookies() ðª
generateServerClientUsingReqRes() ð
Import the cookie-based server Data client in your Next.js React Server Component code and make your API requests.
Import the NextRequest/NextResponse-based server Data client in your Next.js server runtime code and make your API requests within the
runWithAmplifyServerContext
function. Review
Server-side Rendering
to learn more about creating an Amplify server context.
For example, in a Next.js Pages Router API route, use the
req
and
res
parameters from the
handler
function with
runWithAmplifyServerContext
