Storing analytics data
The Amazon Data Firehose analytics provider allows you to send analytics data to an
Amazon Data Firehose
stream for reliably storing data.
The following is an example utilizing the
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
to create the Analytics resource powered by
Amazon Data Firehose
.
Let's create a storage bucket to store the data from the Firehose stream.
next, let's create the Firehose resource.
Ensure you have
setup IAM permissions
for
firehose:PutRecordBatch
.
Example IAM policy for Amazon Data Firehose:
Configure Firehose:
You can send a data to a Firehose stream with the standard
record
method. Any data is acceptable and
streamName
is required:
The recorded events are saved in a buffer and sent to the remote server periodically
(You can tune it with the
flushInterval
option)
. If needed, you have the option to manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the 'flushEvents' API.
