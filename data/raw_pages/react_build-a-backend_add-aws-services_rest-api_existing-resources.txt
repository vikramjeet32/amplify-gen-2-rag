Use existing AWS resources
Existing Amazon API Gateway resources can be used with the Amplify Libraries by calling
Amplify.configure()
with the API Gateway API name and options. Note, you will need to parse the Amplify configuration using
parseAmplifyConfig
before calling
Amplify.configure()
. The following example shows how to configure additional API Gateway resources to an existing Amplify application:
YourAPIName
: Friendly name for the API
endpoint
: The HTTPS endpoint of the API
region
: AWS Region where the resources are provisioned. If not specified, the region will be inferred from the endpoint.
Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see
Install Amplify Libraries
.
