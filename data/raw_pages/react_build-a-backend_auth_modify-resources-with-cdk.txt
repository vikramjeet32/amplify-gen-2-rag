Modify Amplify-generated Cognito resources with CDK
Amplify Auth provides sensible defaults for the underlying Amazon Cognito resource definitions. You can customize your authentication resource to enable it to behave exactly as needed for your use cases by modifying it directly using
AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
You can override the password policy by using the L1
cfnUserPool
construct and adding a
addPropertyOverride
.
While Email MFA is not yet supported with
defineAuth
, this feature can be enabled by modifying the underlying CDK construct.
Start by ensuring your
defineAuth
resource configuration includes a compatible account recovery option and a custom SES sender.
Next, extend the underlying CDK construct by activating
Amazon Cognito's Advanced Security Features (ASF)
and add
EMAIL_OTP
to the enabled MFA options.
You can modify the underlying Cognito user pool resource to enable sign in with passwordless methods.
