Connect to AWS resources
Amplify client libraries provide you with the flexibility to directly connect your application to AWS resources such as AWS AppSync, Amazon Cognito, Amazon S3, and more.
To get started, client libraries must be
configured
. This is typically done by using the
amplify_outputs.json
file
generated by the Amplify backend tooling, however using the client libraries does not require backend resources to be created by Amplify.
For JavaScript-based applications, the client library can be configured by using the generated outputs file:
Or by configuring the library directly by passing a
ResourcesConfig
object. For example, to configure the client library for use with Amazon Cognito, specify the
Auth
configuration:
By configuring the client library, Amplify automates the communication with the underlying AWS resources, and provides a friendly API to author your business logic. In the snippet below, the
signIn
function does not require passing information from your Cognito resource to initiate the sign-in flow.
