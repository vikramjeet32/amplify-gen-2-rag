Set up Amplify Geo
Amplify provides APIs and map UI components for maps and location search for your web apps.You can add maps and location search functionality to your app in just a few lines of code. The following is an example utilizing the
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
to create a Geo resource powered by
Amazon Location Services
. But do note there are no official hand-written (L2) constructs for this service yet.
To display a map in your application, you can use the
Amplify React MapView component
or the
MapLibre GL
with
maplibre-gl-js-amplify
libraries are required.
Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
Note:
Make sure that version
6.0.0
or above is installed.
Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point.
Make sure you call
Amplify.configure
as early as possible in your applicationâs life-cycle. A missing configuration or
NoCredentials
error is thrown if
Amplify.configure
has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs.
Notes:
If you want to use existing Amazon Location Service resources
follow this guide
instead.
If you want to use Amazon Location Service APIs not directly supported by Geo, use the
escape hatch
to access the Amazon Location Service SDK.
