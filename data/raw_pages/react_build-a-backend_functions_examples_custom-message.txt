Custom message
You can use
defineAuth
and
defineFunction
to create an
Amazon Cognito custom message AWS Lambda trigger
thats sends an custom email or phone verification message, or a multi-factor authentication (MFA) code.
To get started, install
@types/aws-lambda
package that will be used to define the type of the handler:
Next, create a new directory and a resource file,
amplify/auth/custom-message/resource.ts
. Then, define the function with
defineFunction
:
Next, create the corresponding handler file,
amplify/auth/custom-message/handler.ts
, file with the following contents:
The input event for the
CustomMessage_AdminCreateUser
trigger source includes both a username and verification code. Admin-created users must receive both their username and code in order to sign in and thus you must include both the
usernameParameter
and
codeParameter
in your message template.
Lastly, set the newly created function resource on your auth resource:
After deploying the changes, whenever a user with user attribute
locale
set to
es
attempts to reset a password they will receive an email with a one-time code in Spanish.
