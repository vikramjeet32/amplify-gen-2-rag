Sync messages
To trigger messages, you must sync them from your In-App Messaging campaigns to your users' devices. These messages are then triggered with an analytics or In-App Messaging event. You can control when and how often this sync is performed.
Note:
Syncing messages will always overwrite existing messages currently on the user's device so that they are always up to date when the sync is performed.
