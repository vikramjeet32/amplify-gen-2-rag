Set up Amplify HTTP API
Using the
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
, you can configure Amplify Functions as resolvers for routes of an
HTTP API powered by Amazon API Gateway
.
To get started, create a new directory and a resource file,
amplify/functions/api-function/resource.ts
. Then, define the function with
defineFunction
:
Then, create the corresponding handler file,
amplify/functions/api-function/handler.ts
, file with the following contents:
Next, using the AWS CDK, create an HTTP API in your backend file:
Use the package manager of your choice to install the Amplify JavaScript library. For example, with
npm
:
To initialize the Amplify API category you need to configure Amplify with
Amplify.configure()
.
Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example
src/main.ts
:
Make sure you call
Amplify.configure
as early as possible in your applicationâs life-cycle. A missing configuration or
NoCredentials
error is thrown if
Amplify.configure
has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs. Review the
Library Not Configured Troubleshooting guide
for possible causes of this issue.
