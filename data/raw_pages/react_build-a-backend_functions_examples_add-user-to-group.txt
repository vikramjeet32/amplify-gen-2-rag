Add user to group
You can use
defineAuth
and
defineFunction
to create a
Cognito post confirmation Lambda trigger
that extends the behavior to perform some action when a user is confirmed.
A user is "confirmed" when they verify their account. Typically this happens when the user confirms their email via the verification email. The post confirmation handler will
not
be triggered for federated sign-ins (i.e. social sign-in).
To get started, install the AWS SDK v3 package, which will be used to perform actions against your auth resource, and the
@types/aws-lambda
package, which is used to define the handler type:
Next, create a new directory and a resource file,
amplify/auth/post-confirmation/resource.ts
. Then, define the Function with
defineFunction
:
After creating the Function definition you will need to:
create the
EVERYONE
group
grant access to your auth resource to ensure it can perform the
addUserToGroup
action
set the Function as the post confirmation trigger
Then create the Function's corresponding handler file,
amplify/auth/post-confirmation/handler.ts
, file with the following contents:
After deploying the changes, whenever a user signs up and verifies their account they are automatically added to the group named "EVERYONE".
