Email customization
By default, Amplify Auth resources are scaffolded with email as the default method for your users to sign in. When you users sign up they receive a verification email to confirm their ownership of the email they specified during sign-up. Emails such as the verification email can be customized with your app's brand identity.
To get started, change the
email
attribute of
loginWith
from
true
to an object to begin customizing its default behavior:
In some cases, you may
set up a user account on behalf of a user in the Amplify console
. In this case, Amplify Auth will send an invitation email to the user welcoming them to your application. This email includes a brief welcome message, along with the email address they can log in with and the temporary password you've set up for them.
If you'd like to customize that email, you can override the
userInvitation
attribute of the
email
object:
Note that when using the
user
and
code
arguments of the
emailBody
function,
user
and
code
are
functions
which must be called. Failure to call them will result in an error when your sandbox deploys.
