Set up Amplify Interactions
AWS Amplify Interactions enables AI-powered chatbots in your web or mobile apps. You can use
Interactions
to configure your backend chatbot provider and to integrate a chatbot UI into your app with just a single line of code.
AWS Amplify supports
Amazon Lex
as the default chatbots service. Amazon Lex supports creating conversational bots with the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa.
You can create an Amazon Lex V2 chatbot in Amazon Lex console. To create your bot, follow the steps shown in
Amazon Lex V2 Developer Guide
.
Amazon Lex service requires an IAM policy in order to use the interactions APIs (
remember to replace the template with real value
):
Add the aws-amplify and interactions package to your project:
Make sure that the
@aws-amplify/interactions
package has the same version number as the
aws-amplify
package in your
package.json
file.
Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example,
App.js
(Expo) or
index.js
(React Native CLI).
Make sure you call
Amplify.configure
as early as possible in your applicationâs life-cycle. A missing configuration or
NoCredentials
error is thrown if
Amplify.configure
has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs. Review the
Library Not Configured Troubleshooting guide
for possible causes of this issue.
