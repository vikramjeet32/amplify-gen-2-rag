Extend S3 resources
Amplify Storage generates Amazon S3 resources to offer storage features. You can access the underlying Amazon S3 resources to further customize your backend configuration by using the AWS Cloud Developer Kit (AWS CDK).
The following is an example of how you would enable Transfer Acceleration on the bucket (
CDK documentation
). In order to enable Transfer Acceleration on the bucket, you will have to unwrap the L1 CDK construct from the L2 CDK construct like the following.

To make calls to your S3 bucket from your App, you need to set up a CORS Policy for your S3 bucket. This callout is only for manual configuration of your S3 bucket.
The following steps will set up your CORS Policy:
Go to
Amazon S3 console
and click on your project's
userfiles
bucket, which is normally named as [Bucket Name][Id]-dev.
Click on the
Permissions
tab for your bucket.
Click the edit button in the
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
section.
Make the Changes and click on Save Changes. You can add required metadata to be exposed in
ExposeHeaders
with
x-amz-meta-XXXX
format.
Note:
You can restrict the access to your bucket by updating AllowedOrigin to include individual domains.
