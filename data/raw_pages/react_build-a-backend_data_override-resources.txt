Modify Amplify-generated AWS resources
Amplify GraphQL API uses a variety of auto-generated, underlying AWS services and resources. You can customize these underlying resources to optimize the deployed stack for your specific use case.
In your Amplify app, you can access every underlying resource using CDK
"L2"
or
"L1"
constructs. Access the generated resources as L2 constructs via the
.resources
property on the returned stack or access the generated resources as L1 constructs using the
.resources.cfnResources
property.
Apply all the customizations on
backend.data.resources.graphqlApi
or
backend.data.resources.cfnResources.cfnGraphqlApi
. For example, to enable X-Ray tracing for the AppSync GraphQL API:
Pass in the model type name into
backend.data.resources.amplifyDynamoDbTables["MODEL_NAME"]
to modify the resources generated for that particular model type. For example, to enable time-to-live on the Todo
@model
type's DynamoDB table:
Set the
DynamoDB billing mode
for the DynamoDB table as either "PROVISIONED" or "PAY_PER_REQUEST".
Override the default
ProvisionedThroughput
provisioned for each model table and its Global Secondary Indexes (GSI). This override is only valid if the "DynamoDBBillingMode" is set to "PROVISIONED".
Enable/disable
DynamoDB point-in-time recovery
for each model table.
