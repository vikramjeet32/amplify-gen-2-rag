Streaming logs
Amplify enables you to stream logs from your AWS Lambda functions directly to your terminal while running
ampx sandbox
. To get started, specify the
--stream-function-logs
option when starting sandbox:
Note
: this feature is only available for
Sandbox
Streaming function logs directly to your terminal enable faster debug iterations, and greater insight into your functions' executions.
By default, Amplify will stream all of your functions' logs. If you wish to only stream a subset of functions you can specify a filter by function name or a regular expression for function names. For example, if you have a collection of
Auth triggers
where the function names include "auth".
When working with more than 5 functions, we recommend using the
--logs-filter
flag to filter the log output to specific functions.
After you successfully deploy your personal cloud sandbox, start your frontend application, and sign up for the first time, you will see logs from your triggers' executions printed to the terminal where sandbox is running.
By default, Amplify will print logs to the terminal where sandbox is running, however you can alternatively write logs to a file by specifying
--logs-out-file
:
This can be combined with
--logs-filter
to create a log file of just your Auth-related functions, for example:
However it cannot be combined multiple times to write logs to multiple files.
