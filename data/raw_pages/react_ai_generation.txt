Generation
AI generation routes are a request-response API used to generate structured output from AI models. Examples of generation routes include:
generated structured data from unstructured input
summarization
Under the hood, a generation route is an AWS AppSync query that ensures the AI model responds with the response type defined for the route.
You can influence response generation by setting inference parameters for the AI model.
This ability to control the randomness and diversity of responses is useful for generating responses that are tailored to your needs.

For example, the following schema defines a
Recipe
model, but this model cannot be used as the return type of a generation route.
You can, however, reference custom types. Here's an example of a custom type that can be used as the return type of a generation route.
The following AppSync scalar types are not supported as

fields in response types:
