Automatically track sessions
Analytics auto tracking helps you to automatically track user behaviors like sessions' start/stop, page view change and web events like clicking or mouseover.
You can track the session both in a web app or a React Native app by using Analytics. A web session can be defined in different ways. To keep it simple, we define a web session as being active when the page is not hidden and inactive when the page is hidden. A session in a React Native app is active when the app is in the foreground and inactive when the app is in the background.
For example:
