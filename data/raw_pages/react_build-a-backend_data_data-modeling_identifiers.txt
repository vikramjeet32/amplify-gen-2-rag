Customize data model identifiers
Identifiers are defined using the
.identifier()
method on a model definition. Usage of the
.identifier()
method is optional; when it's not present, the model will automatically have a field called
id
of type
ID
that is automatically generated unless manually specified.
If you want, you can use Amplify Data to define single-field and composite identifiers:
Single-field identifier with a consumer-provided value (type:
id
or
string
, and must be marked
required
)
Composite identifier with a set of consumer-provided values (type:
id
or
string
, and must be marked
required
)
If the default
id
identifier field needs to be customized, you can do so by passing the name of another field.
For cases where items are uniquely identified by more than a single field, you can pass an array of the field names to the
identifier()
function:
