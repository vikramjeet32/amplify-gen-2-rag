Upload files
You can implement upload functionality in your app by either using the File Uploader UI component or further customizing the upload experience using the upload API.
Upload files from your app in minutes by using the cloud-connected File Uploader UI Component.
Then, use the component in your app.
Learn more about how you can further customize the UI component by referring to the
File Uploader documentation
.
The following is an example of how you would upload a file from a file object, this could be retrieved from the local machine or a different source.
You can follow this example if you have data saved in memory and would like to upload this data to the cloud.
You can also perform an upload operation to a specific bucket by providing the
bucket
option. You can pass in a string representing the target bucket's assigned name in Amplify Backend.
import
{
uploadData
}
from
'aws-amplify/storage'
;
const
result
=
await
uploadData
(
{
path
:
'album/2024/1.jpg'
,
Copy
highlighted code example
bucket
:
'assignedNameInAmplifyBackend'
Alternatively, you can also pass in an object by specifying the bucket name and region from the console.
import
{
uploadData
}
from
'aws-amplify/storage'
;
const
result
=
await
uploadData
(
{
path
:
'album/2024/1.jpg'
,
Copy
highlighted code example
bucketName
:
'bucket-name-from-console'
,
Monitor progress of upload by using the
onProgress
option.
We have callback functions that support resuming, pausing, and cancelling
uploadData
requests.
Custom metadata can be associated with your uploaded object by passing the metadata option.
The behavior of
uploadData
and properties of the uploaded object can be customized by passing in additional options.
Uploads that were initiated over one hour ago will be cancelled automatically. There are instances (e.g. device went offline, user logs out) where the incomplete file remains in your Amazon S3 account. It is recommended to
setup a S3 lifecycle rule
to automatically cleanup incomplete upload requests.
Amplify will automatically perform an Amazon S3 multipart upload for objects that are larger than 5MB. For more information about S3's multipart upload, see
