Using the Authenticator
The quickest way to get started with Amplify Auth in your frontend application is with the
Authenticator component
, which provides a customizable UI and complete authentication flows.
The Authenticator component is automatically configured based on the outputs generated from your backend. To learn more about the Authenticator and how to customize its appearance, visit the
Amplify UI documentation
.
Conversely, you can bring your own UI and leverage the library from
aws-amplify
to handle authentication flows manually.
