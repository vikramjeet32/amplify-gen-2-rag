Custom Auth Challenge
Secure Remote Password (SRP) is a cryptographic protocol enabling password-based authentication without transmitting the password over the network. In Amazon Cognito custom authentication flows, CUSTOM_WITH_SRP incorporates SRP steps for enhanced security, while CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP bypasses these for a simpler process. The choice between them depends on your application's security needs and performance requirements.
This guide demonstrates how to implement both types of custom authentication flows using AWS Amplify with Lambda triggers.
You can use
defineAuth
and
defineFunction
to create an auth experience that uses
CUSTOM_WITH_SRP
and
CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP
. This can be accomplished by leveraging
Amazon Cognito's feature to define a custom auth challenge
and 3 triggers:
Create auth challenge
Define auth challenge
Verify auth challenge response
To get started, install the
aws-lambda
package, which is used to define the handler type.
To get started, create the first of the three triggers,
create-auth-challenge
. This is the trigger responsible for creating the reCAPTCHA challenge after a password is verified.
After creating the resource file, create the handler with the following contents:
Next, you will want to create the trigger responsible for
defining
the auth challenge flow,
define-auth-challenge
.
After creating the resource file, create the handler with the following contents if you are using
CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP
:
Or if you are using
CUSTOM_WITH_SRP
:
Lastly, create the trigger responsible for
verifying
the challenge response. For the purpose of this example, the verification check will always return true.
After creating the resource file, create the handler with the following contents:
Finally, import and set the three triggers on your auth resource:
After deploying the changes, whenever a user attempts to sign in with
CUSTOM_WITH_SRP
or
CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP
, the Lambda challenges will be triggered.
