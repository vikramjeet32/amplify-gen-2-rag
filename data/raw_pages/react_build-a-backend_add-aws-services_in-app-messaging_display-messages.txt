Display messages
In-app messages are displayed when an In-App Messaging or analytics event is sent and matches the criteria defined by your active In-App Messaging campaigns.
Now that messages have been synced to your users' devices, Amplify In-App Messaging will allow you to start displaying them with Amplify Analytics events with no additional integration steps. Any events you record or are already recording using the Analytics'
record
API are automatically picked up and processed by In-App Messaging. If the event matches the attributes and criteria defined in an in-app message, that message will be displayed.
If the event name, attributes, and metrics match those set forth by one of your In-App Messaging campaigns, you should see the in-app message displayed in your app.
In addition to or instead of Amplify Analytics events, you can also dispatch In-App Messaging events to trigger an in-app message display programmatically.
If the event name, attributes, and metrics match those set forth by one of your In-App Messaging campaigns, you should see the in-app message displayed in your app.
