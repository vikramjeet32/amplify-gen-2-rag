Troubleshoot CDKToolkit stack issues
AWS Amplify requires your AWS account and region to be
bootstrapped
in order to deploy resources into your account. Amplify uses the
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
to scaffold backend resource configurations and orchestrate deployments by using the supplemental resources created by the process of bootstrapping.
Bootstrapping
is the process of preparing your AWS environment for usage with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). Before you deploy a CDK stack into an AWS environment, the environment must first be bootstrapped.
Learn more about bootstrapping by visiting the
AWS documentation for AWS CDK's concept of bootstrapping
.
When deploying an Amplify app you may be redirected to the Amplify Console to complete bootstrapping for your current account ID and region. If this process encounters an error you will be prompted with the following message:
This typically indicates one or more of the resources within the
CDKToolkit
stack has failed to create or update. Navigate to the
AWS CloudFormation console
, select your
CDKToolkit
stack, and select the "Events" tab to view resource events. Here you may identify issues with the corresponding
assets bucket
or issues with the IAM roles used for deployments.
You can mitigate by manually updating your
CDKToolkit
stack using the browser-based
AWS CloudShell
:
Or by running
bootstrap
using the AWS CDK CLI from your terminal:
If you continue to experience this issue after applying the workaround noted above, please file an issue in the
GitHub repository for Amplify Backend
