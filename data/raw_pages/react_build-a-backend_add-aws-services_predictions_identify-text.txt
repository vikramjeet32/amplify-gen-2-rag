Detect text in an input image. Input can be sent directly from the browser or an Amazon S3 key from project bucket.
The following options are independent of which
source
is specified. For demonstration purposes we will reference a
file
but it can be an S3 Key as well.
Predictions.identify({text : {...}})
can detect unstructured text
PLAIN
, structured text from tables
TABLE
or text from forms
FORM
.
For detecting plain text, you can see the whole detected text, the lines detected, the position of each line of text, and each word.
For detecting structured forms (documents, tables, etc.) from an image,
keyValues
will return a string of the entity found in the image as well as metadata such as selected checkboxes or the relative location in the image using a
boundingBox
.
For example the below image would return
keyValues
with "Test" or "Checked" as a key, and
true
since they are selected. The location of these elements would be returned in the
boundingBox
value.
For detecting structured tables from an image
For detecting tables and forms on the image just select format "ALL"
