Clear messages
Once messages have been synced to your user's device,
clearMessages()
can be used to clear the synced messages.
Note:
If your app has authentication implemented, we recommend calling
clearMessages()
in between user log-ins to remove messages targeted for specific user segments. This is especially important if you anticipate your application will be used in shared device scenarios.
