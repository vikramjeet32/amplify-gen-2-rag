Share resources across branches
In some instances, you may not want to deploy new resources for every branch. For example, you might want all your
feature
branches to point to the backend resources deployed by the
dev
branch so you can reuse seed data, users, and groups.
You can update your app build settings to share resources across branches. From the Amplify console, go to your
App overview
page, select
Build settings
under the
Hosting
for viewing your app's build specification YAML file.
Update the build settings for the
backend
phase to run
npx ampx generate outputs --branch dev app-id $AWS_APP_ID
to generate the
amplify_outputs.json
file for all branches other than
main
or
dev
. After this update, any new deployed branches will not deploy backend resources as part of the build and instead will use the deployed backend resources from the
dev
branch.
