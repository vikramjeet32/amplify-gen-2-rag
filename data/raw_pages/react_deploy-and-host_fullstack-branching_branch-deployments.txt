Fullstack branch deployments
Amplify code-first DX (Gen 2) offers fullstack branch deployments that allow you to automatically deploy infrastructure and application code changes from feature branches. This enables testing changes in an isolated environment before merging to the main branch.
After you've deployed your
first branch
, you can manually connect more, but the recommended workflow is to use the
branch auto-detection
feature.
Log in to the
Amplify console
and choose your app.
Navigate to
App settings > Branch settings
, select
Edit
and enable
Branch auto-detection
and
Branch auto-disconnection
. The following video uses the default settings, which will connect any branch in your repo automatically. Branch auto-disconnection will ensure that if you delete a branch from your repository, the branch will also be deleted.
You can also define a pattern to connect only certain branches. For example, setting
dev
,
staging
, and
feature/*
will automatically connect all three branch types. Your
dev
and
staging
branches, as well as any branch that begins with
feature/
, will be connected.
Push a commit to your
feature/A
and
staging
branches that match the pattern. You should start seeing deployments on the console page. You will now have three fullstack branches deployed.
In Gen 2, promoting changes to production follows the normal Git-based workflow.
Make a change in your
feature/A
branch.
Submit a pull request to your
main
branch. Once your team has validated the changes, merge the pull request to
main
. This will initiate a build on your
main
branch and update any frontend or backend resources that you changed.
You can generate the config for a branch environment by running:
