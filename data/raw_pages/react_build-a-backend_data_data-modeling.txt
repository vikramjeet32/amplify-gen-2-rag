Customize your data model
Every data model is defined as part of a data schema (
a.schema()
). You can enhance your data model with various fields, customize their identifiers, apply authorization rules, or model relationships. Every data model (
a.model()
) automatically provides create, read, update, and delete API operations as well as real-time subscription events. Below is a quick tour of the many functionalities you can add to your data model:
If you are coming from Gen 1, you can continue to use the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) for defining your schema. However, we strongly recommend you use the TypeScript-first schema builder experience in your project as it provides type safety and is the recommended way of working with Amplify going forward.
Note:
Some features available in Gen 1 GraphQL SDL are not available in Gen 2. See the
feature matrix
for features supported in Gen 2.
