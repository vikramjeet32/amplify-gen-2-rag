We advice you to go through the

You can optionally configure the data provider and result storage location for your location search index.
You can select a data provider as the source for geocoding, reverse geocoding and searches.
Each provider gathers and curates their data using different means. They may also have varying expertise in different regions of the world.
The available data providers of geospatial data are shown. To learn more about data providers, please refer this
