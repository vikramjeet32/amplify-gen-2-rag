Kinesis
stream for real-time processing.
The following is an example utilizing the
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
to create the Analytics resource powered by

Configure Kinesis:
You can send a data to a Kinesis stream with the standard
record()
method:
The recorded events are saved in a buffer and sent to the remote server periodically
(You can tune it with the
flushInterval
option)
. If needed, you have the option to manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the 'flushEvents' API.
