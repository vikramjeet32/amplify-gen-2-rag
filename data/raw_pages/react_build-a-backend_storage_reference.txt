Get a temporary presigned URL to download the specified S3 object.
The presigned URL expires when the associated role used to sign the request expires or
the option
expiresIn
is reached. The
expiresAt
property in the output object indicates when the URL MAY expire.
By default, it will not validate the object that exists in S3. If you set the
options.validateObjectExistence
to true, this method will verify the given object already exists in S3 before returning a presigned
URL, and will throw
StorageError
if the object does not exist.
