Manage user sessions
Amplify Auth provides access to current user sessions and tokens to help you retrieve your user's information to determine if they are signed in with a valid session and control their access to your app.
You can use the
getCurrentUser
API to get information about the currently authenticated user including the
username
,
userId
and
signInDetails
.
This method can be used to check if a user is signed in. It throws an error if the user is not authenticated.
The user's
signInDetails
are not supported when using the
Hosted UI
or the
signInWithRedirect
API.
Your user's session is their signed-in state, which grants them access to your app. When your users sign in, their credentials are exchanged for temporary access tokens. You can get session details to access these tokens and use this information to validate user access or perform actions unique to that user.
If you only need the session details, you can use the
fetchAuthSession
API which returns a
tokens
object containing the JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
The
fetchAuthSession
API automatically refreshes the user's session when the authentication tokens have expired and a valid
refreshToken
is present. Additionally, you can also refresh the session explicitly by calling the
fetchAuthSession
API with the
forceRefresh
flag enabled.
Warning:
by default, sessions from external identity providers cannot be refreshed.
