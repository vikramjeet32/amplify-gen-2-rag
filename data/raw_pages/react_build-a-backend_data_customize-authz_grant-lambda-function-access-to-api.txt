Grant Lambda function access to API and Data
Function access to
defineData
can be configured using an authorization rule on the schema object.
Create a new directory and a resource file,
amplify/functions/data-access/resource.ts
. Then, define the Function with
defineFunction
:
The object returned from
defineFunction
can be passed directly to
allow.resource()
in the schema authorization rules. This will grant the function the ability to execute Query, Mutation, and Subscription operations against the GraphQL API. Use the
.to()
method to narrow down access to one or more operations.
Function access can only be configured on the schema object. It cannot be configured on individual models or fields.
In the handler file for your function, configure the Amplify data client
When configuring Amplify with
getAmplifyDataClientConfig
, your function consumes schema information from an S3 bucket created during backend deployment with grants for the access your function need to use it. Any changes to this bucket outside of backend deployment may break your function.
Once you have generated the client code, update the function to access the data. The following code creates a todo and then lists all todos.
