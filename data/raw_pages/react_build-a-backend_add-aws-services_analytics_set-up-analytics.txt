Set up Amplify Analytics
Amplify enables you to collect analytics data for your app. In order to use Analytics, you will enable
Amazon Kinesis
or
Amazon Pinpoint
using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). The Analytics category uses
Amazon Cognito identity pools
to
identify
users in your app. Cognito allows you to receive data from authenticated, and unauthenticated users in your app.
Use the
AWS CDK
to create an analytics resource powered by
Amazon Pinpoint
.
First, install the
aws-amplify
library:
Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point.
Next Steps:
Congratulations! Now that you have Analytics' backend provisioned and Analytics library installed. Check out the following links to see Amplify Analytics use cases:
