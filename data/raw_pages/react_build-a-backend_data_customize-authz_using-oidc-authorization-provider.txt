Use OpenID Connect as an authorization provider
Private, owner, and group authorization can be configured with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization mode. Add
"oidc"
to the authorization rule as the provider. Use the
oidcAuthorizationMode
property to configure the
OpenID Connect provider name
,
OpenID Connect provider domain
,
Client ID
,
Issued at TTL
, and
Auth Time TTL
.
The example below highlights the supported authorization strategies with a
oidc
authorization provider. For owner and group-based authorization, you also will need to
specify a custom identity and group claim
.
In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using
client.models.<model-name>
by specifying the
oidc
auth mode.
